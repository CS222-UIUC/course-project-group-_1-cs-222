a)
Our project for CS 222: Software Design Lab is CommunityMap. 
This mobile application allows users to input the location of any potholes or road damages
they run into onto an online map for other users to see. 
The primary purpose of this application is to highlight the presence of potholes and road damage. 
These are generally overlooked by competing apps like Waze, which instead focus on traffic and construction work. 
The mapping of various potholes and road damage can also ensure that 
the local government of the area is aware of the conditions that their roads are in. 
By providing a centralized repository of potholes, we are ensuring that 
users can drive safely by being aware of all road conditions 
and local governments can be aware of the condition of their roads. 
This mobile application was built with Swift and uses the Google Firebase database for data management and storage.

Varun took care of sensor API implementation.
Kushal implemented the primary algorithm to evaluate the potholes.
Varun and Kushal also took care of the user-interface of the application
and how all the features of the app connect and interact with each other.
Aayush was responsible for all implementations related to the Firebase database 
as well as parsing these large amounts of data for read and write functions 
such that it is easy to use in the algorithms sections.
